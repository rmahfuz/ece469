1) How to build solution:

To test q1, q2 and q3 (which is q4),
rm /tmp/ee469vaiyagar.img                    #removing .img file
cd os; make clean; make                      # making os
cd ../apps/fdisk; make clean; make; make run # making and running fdisk
cd ../ostests; make clean; make; make run    #making and running ostests

To test q5 (which is q6),
cd os; make clean; make                      # making os
cd ../apps/fdisk; make clean; make; make run # making and running fdisk
cd ../test_file; make clean; make; make run    #making and running test_file
